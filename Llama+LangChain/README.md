# Llama 3.1 + LangChain Project

This project integrates **Llama 3.1** with **LangChain** for building AI-powered applications. The project uses Python 3.10 and is managed via a Conda environment. Streamlit is used for the web interface.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed
- Python 3.10
- Conda environment for project isolation
- Ollama installed and configured

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create Conda Environment**

```bash
conda create -n env_langchain1 python=3.10
````

> If the environment already exists, Conda will prompt for removal.

2. **Activate Environment**

```bash
conda activate env_langchain1
```

3. **Navigate to Project Directory**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\aaa\Desktop\CV\projects\Llama 3.1 + Langchain"
```

4. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ You might see warnings about ignored distributions. They are usually harmless unless they break functionality.

5. **Pull Llama 3.1 Model**

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

This downloads the Llama 3.1 model locally (\~4.9 GB).

6. **Run the Application**

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see a fun interactive prompt demonstrating LangChain and Llama 3.1 integration.

## Usage

After running `python app.py`, the application can answer questions interactively using the Llama 3.1 model.

Example:

```
Q: What is the capital of France?
A: The capital of France is Paris!
```

---
* Use **Anaconda Prompt** to execute all commands.
* Make sure the project path does not contain invalid characters for Python.
* For Streamlit apps, you can run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* If you encounter dependency conflicts, check the warnings from `pip install` and install missing packages manually.
