            "**Imran Khan** is a prominent Pakistani politician, former cricketer, and philanthropist. He was born on October 5, 1952, in Lahore, Pakistan. Khan is widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in Pakistan's history, having led the national team to its first-ever Cricket World Cup victory in 1992. After retiring from cricket, he entered politics and founded the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in 1996.\n",
            "\n",
            "Khan served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022, when he was removed from office through a no-confidence motion. His political career has been marked by a focus on anti-corruption, social justice, and economic reform. He is also known for his philanthropic work, including the establishment of the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre in Lahore.\n",
